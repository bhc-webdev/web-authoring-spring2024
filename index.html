            <img src="image/meimagecrop.png" alt="my picture">

            <p> My name is <em><strong>Imelda Labang Donchi Ep Kemezeu</strong></em>. I come from <em>Cameroon</em>.I am
                24 years old.I live in UNITED
                STATES OF AMERICA and I am a student at <strong>Dallas College</strong>.I come from a bustling and
                lively family,
                where I am the middle child among five siblings. Our household is always filled with laughter,
                camaraderie, and
                the occasional friendly chaos that comes with having a large family.</p>
            <p>Being a middle child has
                instilled
                in me a sense of diplomacy and adaptability. I've learned to be both a leader and a follower,
                depending on the situation. The experiences of growing up with five siblings have fostered qualities
                such as
                patience,empathy, and a deep understanding of the value of family bonds.Last semester ,I have decided to
                switch in IT world to achieve my goals,and become a successful WEB
                DEVELOPER.

                commitment to optimizing healthcare delivery through technological advancements.</p>
            <p>FALL 2023,I took some courses:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>WEB DESIGN TOOLS</strong></li>
                <li><strong>INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON</strong></li>
                <li><strong>DIGITAL IMAGING I </strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In WEB DESIGN TOOLS course,we used the Visual studio code to write
                our html code and Filezilla to display our page on the server of the school.We used a Git repository for
                our projet files.We also used the W3 validator service,the W3 css-validator and, the wave accessibility
                checker to test and debug the html ,css code and web page. We used a W3 css-library and css-style to
                implement the design of the pages
                (tables,form,color,margin,padding,icons,list...)In this class I have learned how to create a web page,
                to design it for user-friendly, and some other stuff.These will help me to make my first step in the web
                world. The professor was so explicit and available for the questions.</p>
